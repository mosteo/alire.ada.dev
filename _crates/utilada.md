This Ada05 library contains various utility packages for building
Ada05 applications.  This includes:

* A logging framework close to Java log4j framework,
* Support for properties
* A serialization/deserialization framework for XML, JSON, CSV
* Ada beans framework
* Encoding/decoding framework (Base16, Base64, SHA, HMAC-SHA, AES-256)
* A composing stream framework (raw, files, buffers, pipes, sockets)
* Several concurrency tools (reference counters, counters, pools, fifos, arrays)
* Process creation and pipes
* Support for loading shared libraries (on Windows or Unix)
* HTTP client library on top of CURL or AWS

Ada Util also provides a small test utility library on top of
Ahven or AUnit to help in writing unit tests.  Ahven is the default testing
framework as it provides better reports.
